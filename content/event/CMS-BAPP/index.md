abstract: The problem of finding a best approximation pair of two sets, which in
  turn generalizes the well known convex feasibility problem, has a long history
  that dates back to work by Cheney and Goldstein in 1959. In 2018, Aharoni,
  Censor, and Jiang revisited this problem and proposed an algorithm that can be
  used when the two sets are finite intersections of halfspaces. Motivated by
  their work, we present alternative algorithms that utilize projection and
  proximity operators. Numerical experiments indicate that these methods are
  competitive and sometimes superior to the one proposed by Aharoni et al.
