abstract: "Given a piecewise-defined function, checking whether it is convex is
  a nontrivial task. While it may be easy to check whether the restriction of
  the function to each piece is convex, ensuring the entire function is convex
  seems to require global conditions. However, it is known that one only needs
  to ensure the (convex) subdifferential is nonempty on the boundary of the
  pieces thereby obtaining more local conditions. We specialize the results to
  quadratic and cubic piecewise defined functions and provide linear-time
  algorithms to check their convexity. We also provide a MATLAB implementation
  using an edge-list data structure and discuss two applications: checking the
  structure of piecewise quadratic functions and optimization problems involving
  convexity constraints."
