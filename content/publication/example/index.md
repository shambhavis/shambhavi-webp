abstract: " simplex, the convex hull of a set of n+1 affinely independent
  points, is a useful tool in derivative-free optimization. The term uniform
  simplex was used by Audet and Hare (Derivative-free and blackbox optimization.
  Springer series in operations research and financial engineering, Springer,
  Cham, 2017). The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for
  constructing a uniform simplex in $$\\mathbb{R}^n$$, which can then be aligned
  with a given vector. We prove that a uniform simplex has the greatest
  normalized volume of any simplex. Moreover, we show how to create a uniform
  minimal positive basis from a uniform simplex."
